Voting System Implementation Using ICs
This project showcases the implementation of a voting system using integrated circuits (ICs). The system is designed to efficiently count and display votes for multiple candidates. Key components and their functions include:

555 Timer IC: Used to trigger signals each time a vote is pressed.
7490 Decade Counter IC: Counts the number of votes.
7447 BCD to 7-Segment Decoder/Driver IC: Converts binary numbers to decimal for display.
Seven-Segment Display: Shows the number of votes for each candidate.

This project highlights the practical use of digital electronics in creating a reliable and user-friendly voting system. The repository includes schematics, IC datasheets, circuit diagrams, and implementation details.
